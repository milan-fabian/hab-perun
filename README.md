# High altitude balloon project "Perun"

Repository for keeping all sources and notes for my "HAB Perun" project together. Also public, so anybody can copy me (if I don't fail). 

If you have any suggestions or would like to help, let me know (for example via Issue).

## Goal

First goal is to get balloon with camera, GPS and some basic sensors into altitude of at least 10 km and take some wallpaper-worthy pictures there.

## Current state

Just bringing together ideas and notes. Check out <https://github.com/milan-fabian/hab-perun/wiki>.

## Why Perun?
